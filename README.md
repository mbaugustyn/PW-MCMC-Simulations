Source files for simulations used for my masters thesis "Perfect sampling algorithms for hardcore model".

Repo includes implementations of Propp Wilson [PW] algorithms for:
- Hardcore Model (specifically for 3x3, 4x4, 5x5)
  - Classic PW algorithm
  - PW using anti-monotone sandwiching

- Simple "ladder" model for demonstrating
  - PW using monotone sandwiching
